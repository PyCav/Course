    "Having only worked on short, isolated, projects so far, you may not yet realise how often you will end up reusing code. There will often be times when you come back to code that's months - even years - old. The way you've named things will either make this code completely useless, meaning it's actually faster to rewrite the code, or you might be able to edit the code and reuse large bits of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Always give variables, functions, and classes descriptive names**. Most modern editors have autocomplete, so writing a slightly longer variable name shouldn't take too much longer than a shorter, less readable name. It also has the added benefit that the resulting code will be almost self-documented, although obviously, nothing is as good as good documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to Python's lack of static typing, keeping track of the types of arguments that functions take can be a nightmare, as the code will almost certainly expect a certain type of object to be passed for each argument, but it's difficult to tell just by looking at the code. You may be tempted to use Hungarian notation (stating the variable type in the variable name), don't. It's a brittle way to denote types (e.g. you might decide later on that you don't want a vpython vector but rather a numpy array to represent the same data structure, which would mean all your vvec_variables will need to be found and replaced) and makes code less readable. It's better to document the types of variables that a function accepts and returns using comments. Even if you don't do any other documentation, this is a bare minimum which will mark the difference between un-reusable and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make your code readable to any Python programmer, follow the PEP 8 conventions (Or whatever the mainstream convention is for the language you are using; you should easily find conventions by googling). You can read them in full [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), but here are a few of the most important ones to get you started:"

    "\n",
    "* Function names should be lower case, with words spearated by underscores, e.g.: function_name\n",
    "\n",
    "* Method names follow the same convention as function names: e.g. method_name\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you want a function, method, or property to be *private*, prefix the name with an underscore, e.g.: _variable_name _method_name _function_name\n",

    "* Instance methods should always use self for the first argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Class methods should always use cls for the first argument.\n",

Of course, this structure is not always applicable, e.g. variables may need to be declared later on, but one shoudl strive to keep to such a structure for clean, legible code."

    "* Don't \"Hard-code\" variables: e.g. if you're opening a file, have a variable file_path then open the file at that file path instead of just giving the string for the file path to a function to open a file.\n",

Of course, there might be times when you want to learn the algorithm, in which case it's perfectly fine to write your own implementation. However, when you're writing code not to learn but to use, use the external library."
