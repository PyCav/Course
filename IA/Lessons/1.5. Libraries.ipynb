    "Remember when we were trying to get a robot to make tea in the first lesson? Now that we know about functions, we can imagine putting all of the actions (putting water in a kettle, boiling it, etc.) into one function, `make_tea`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as \"things to have a robot do for you\" go, making tea is probably pretty high up on the list. It's a bit wasteful if everyone had to individually write a `make_tea` function. To get around this we can install libraries which allow us to extend functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the library is installed, we can import it into our program with the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import module\n",

    "Any function in the module can now be used in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
