However, there are a number of other parameters that you can optionally set, such as initial guesses for the parameters, and the method used for the fitting. The designers of the function realised that 90% of the time, you don't need to set those parameters yourself, and made the function in such a way that you only need to supply the bare minimum you need to use the function.
