    "### Making a module\n",
    "\n",
    "By this point, you're pronably quite used to importing libraries. Today you'll learn to make them yourself. A library is made of a number of modules. A number is just any file with a .py at the end, i.e., a python script outside of a Jupyter notebook. You can use any text editor to edit them, but some nice ones include Sublime Text and Atom. With a little configuration, they can be configured so that they highlight and autocomplete your code. This setup will be covered in a separate notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "A module consists of a number of functions and classes which you can call from your main block of code. This allows your main block of code to remain nice, clean and organised. It also allows for easier collaboration and sharing of code; in some cases the main block of code may not be relevant and all that they need is the module, so that they can solve a different problem. Try copy and pasting the below code, from the previous lesson, into a file and call it OrbitModule.py . Save it to the same directory (save it in the same folder) as this notebook. The name of a module is defined by the name of the file."
