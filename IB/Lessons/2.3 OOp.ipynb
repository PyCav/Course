    "# 3. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming is a way of programming (a programming paradigm), based on the concept of \"objects\". An object is what you expect an object to be. They have methods, as we learnt last year. In addition to methods, objects have properties. Properties are just variables that are associated with an object and are accesed with a similar syntax to methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we think about a real object like a water bottle, we don't think about all of its properties and methods as an individual. Most water bottles can do more or less the same actions, so we can define a Class called Bottle which defines all the properties every water bottle will have. See the mock class, Bottle, below:"

    "A great thing about Object Oriented Programming is that it allows for you to write code via subclassing. Let's imagine the case of a Person class, with methods to walk, eat and talk, and has a property called personality. Consider the case that we wanted to make a Student class. A Student would be able to do all the things a Person can do, but also has properties of studiousness, intuition, and methods to take exams and go out. It would be a waste to rewrite all the things that are already there in the Person class, so instead, one could subclass Person to create Student. (In this case, Person would be the superclass of Student) This is done in Python by putting the superclass in brackets after the declaration of the class, as shown above. All classes inherit from the base class that is object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a more Physics-like example, where we will subclass the sphere class from vpython, and use it to create a simulation for orbits. The documentation included in the source code should suffice. Similar simulations can be made using the pycav.mechanics module, which uses Velocity Verlet algorithms instead of RK4 for more physical results. Play around with the below code."

    "OOP (Object Oriented Programming) is a powerful way of thinking, but it can take a while for it to \"click\". If it doesn't make sense to you, don't worry; very advanced simulations can be written (and often are due to performance reasons) without OOP. Keep in mind, however, that it can be very helpful to know, especially as a lot of Python libraries are written in an object oriented manner."
